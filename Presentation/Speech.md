**Intro**
Does everyone remember playing a classic game of tiggey or Cops n Robbers?

Basically it involes a chaser and a runner.

How you would have played this game would be that there would be several chasers or cops, and several runners, or robbers.

The cops' task would to catch robbers usually by tapping.

The robbers' task would be to run and stay uncaught for as long as possible, usually by dodging or hiding.

However, the problem with doing that today is that, it is way too efficient for robbers to win by hiding in a random bush.

We've decided to add a twist to this game by including the use of phones, GPS, and internet.

Robbers would have trackers, and coppers would have a sensor which tells them when they are getting hotter or colder towards a particular robber. Essentially coppers would have an assistant which allows them to find robbers when the play area is increased.


The technologies we've been using are google api, bootstrap, javascript modules express and node.js, git.

Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript
