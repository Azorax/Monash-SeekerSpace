**Intro**
Just some clarification - although our team name is IDLE Master race, our project name is Monash Seeker Space

Does everyone remember playing a classic - age-old game of tiggey or Cops n Robbers?

For those of you who have been unfortunate to have missed out, it basically involves a chaser and a runner.

How you would have played this game would be that there would be 1 or several chasers or cops, and several runners, or robbers.

We're want to bring it back! Bring back the fun of chasing and running that we had as a kid.

We've decided to add a modern twist to this game by including the use of phones, GPS, and internet.

Robbers would have trackers, and coppers would have a sensor which tells them when they are getting hotter or colder towards a particular robber. Essentially coppers would have an assistant which allows them to find robbers when the play area is increased.

**Show stuff we did**

1. We have an initial screen explaining the basic rules of the game
    1. You will be designated a copper or robber
    2. The coppers win by approaching within 1m of a robber and 'catching' them
    3. Robbers win by eluding the coppers for the given time limit

The technologies we've been using are HTML5 google maps api, bootstrap, javascript modules express and node.js, git.

Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript



Other features that could be added would be tied in with additional rules such as:
- The app will only designate coppers and robbers once everyone is sufficiently far apart.
    - This allows for the players to now know who a robber is and who a copper is
- Robbers get points the longer they stay in 1 place
- Map area limit (restrictions) because Clayton Campus is large
- They can spend said points on effects or power ups such as
    - Disable scanner for a minute, 
    - Hack into the tracker to make their location point towards someone else
    - If 2 robbers find each other
